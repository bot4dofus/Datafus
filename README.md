# Datafus

Datafus builds the dofus database by extracting the Dofus files. The objectives are multiple:
- Extract the Dofus source code and make it public
- Build a JSON database representing all the socket events
- Extract D2O files and build a JSON database containing all the entities in the game
- Extract D2I files and build a JSON database for string translation
- Build Java classes for socket events
- Build Java classes for entities
- Compare differencies between versions

## Download the data

If you need the data in local for your project, you can download it in the [release section](https://github.com/LucBerge/Datafus/releases/latest).
