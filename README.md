# Datafus

Datafus builds the dofus database by extracting the Dofus files. The objectives are multiple:
- Extract the Dofus source code and make it public
- Build a JSON database representing all the socket events
- Extract D2O files and build a JSON database containing all the entities in the game
- Extract D2I files and build a JSON database for string translation
- Build Java classes for socket events
- Build Java classes for entities
- Compare differencies between versions
